On Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), you can record a movie of your on-screen actions with the QuickTime Player application by choosing File &gt; New Screen Recording.  For more complicated issues, this may help us understand more quickly than a long text explanation, and it saves you the time of writing one.

For hanging issues (CoverSutra becomes unresponsive with a spinning rainbow cursor), please use Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Activity Monitor to obtain a sample of the CoverSutra process, and attach that sample to your email.
